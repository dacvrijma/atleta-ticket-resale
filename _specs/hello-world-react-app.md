# Hello World React App

## Overview

A minimal React application that displays a "Hello World" message, styled with Tailwind CSS. This serves as the foundation of the project and demonstrates the basic setup of React and Tailwind working together.

## Goals

- Render a simple "Hello World" page using React
- Apply basic Tailwind CSS styling to the page
- Confirm that the React + Tailwind toolchain is correctly configured and functional

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to see a working React app with Tailwind so that I can confirm the stack is set up correctly
- As a visitor, I want to see a styled "Hello World" message so that the page feels intentional and presentable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The app renders in the browser without errors
- [ ] A "Hello World" heading is visible on the page
- [ ] The heading is styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes
- [ ] The app uses React functional components

## Out of Scope

- Routing or multiple pages
- State management
- Backend or API integration
- Authentication

## Notes

- Keep it as simple as possible — this is a starter scaffold, not a full application
- Tailwind should be configured via the standard PostCSS setup or Vite plugin
